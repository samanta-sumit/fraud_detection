# fraud_detection

step1) is to download the fraud dataset and the problem u r going to solve 
step 2) after downloading the dataset u need preprocess the data as by removing duplicates ,addressing missing values ,identifying outliers and deciding weather to keep them for further use or not ,converting catgorical values into numerical values 
step3) now u need to undestand the data and do some analysis ,u can start with eda and knw all the basic discriptive  analysis
step4)to understand pattern,to chedck if there is any multicolinearity between features if there is then creat new features
step5)the data part is done where our data is ready to be feed to our ml model ,now u need to decide the suitable ml model for your task
step6)afte implementation of ml model u need to check the accuray and  and presision value and tey diffrent algorithms and choose the algorithm with best accuracy and presission recall value
step6)visualiztion is imp if u can visualise during the data analysis part and cunfusion matirx part
